## Machine Learning Model

The stock prediction feature uses a machine learning model to forecast the closing prices of stocks for the next 30 days. The model is trained on historical stock price data and leverages techniques such as time series analysis and regression models.

### Training the Model

To train the model on new data:
1. Prepare the dataset with historical stock prices.
2. Run the training script:
   ```sh
   python train_stock_model.py
   ```

3. The trained model will be saved and used for future predictions.
